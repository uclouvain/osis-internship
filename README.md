### Updating your Fork

It's a good practice to update your fork before submiting a new pull request. It helps the project manager on his demanding job of merging and solving conflits on the code. To update your fork, add a new remote link pointing to the original repository:

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-louvain.git

This step is performed only once because Git preserves a list of remote links locally. Fetch the content of upstream in order to perform a merge with your local `master` branch:

    $ git fetch upstream

Then, go to the local `master` branch (if you are not already there) and merge it with upstream's `master` branch:

    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge upstream/master

Finally, push your master branch to your own repository:

    $ git push origin master

Now, you are ready to write your contributions.
